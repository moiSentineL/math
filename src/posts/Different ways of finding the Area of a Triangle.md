There are multiple ways of finding the area of a triangle, from unconventional to completely straight forward ways. These are a few of them:

[[toc]]

## the 1/2 x base x height

$$
\begin{lgathered}
\frac{1}{2} \times base \times height
\end{lgathered}
$$
That's what we all know.
## Heron's Formula

$$
\begin{lgathered}
\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}
\end{lgathered}
$$
where $s$ is the semi-perimeter ($\frac{1}{2} \times perimeter$) and $a,b,c$ are the length of the sides.

See Proof (Part [1](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry-home/geometry-volume-surface-area/heron-formula-tutorial/v/part-1-of-proof-of-heron-s-formula), [2](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry-home/geometry-volume-surface-area/heron-formula-tutorial/v/part-2-of-the-proof-of-heron-s-formula))
## Coordinate Formula

$$
\begin{lgathered}
\frac{1}{2} \cdot [x_{1} \cdot (y_{2} - y_{3}) + x_{2} \cdot (y_{3}-y_{1}) + x_{3} (y_{1} - y_{2})] 
\end{lgathered}
$$

where $(x_{i}, y_{i})$ are the coordinates of the three vertices of the triangle in a coordinate plane.

See [Proof](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/in-in-grade-10-ncert/x573d8ce20721c073:coordinate-geometry/x573d8ce20721c073:area-of-a-triangle/v/area-of-triangle-formula-derivation)

## 1/2 x Determinant of a 2x2 matrix

$$
\begin{lgathered}
\frac{1}{2} \times \det \mathbf{A} \\
\frac{1}{2} \times \left|\begin{matrix}
a&b \\ c&d
\end{matrix}\right|
\end{lgathered}
$$

Well, $\det \mathbf{A}$ gives you the area of a parallelogram. Which means, **twice** the area of a triangle.

See [Proof](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/matrix-transformations/determinant-depth/v/linear-algebra-determinant-and-area-of-a-parallelogram)

## 1/2 x magnitude of vector cross-product

$$
\begin{lgathered}
\frac{1}{2} \times | \vec{a} \times \vec{b} |
\end{lgathered}
$$

Since $| \vec{a} \times \vec{b} |$ is essentially the area of the parallelogram ($\because | \vec{a} \times \vec{b} | = a \times b \times \sin \theta \rightarrow base \times height$), the half of it will equal to the area of the triangle subtended by the vectors.

And all you have to do now is to use the right method at the right time, which is the hardest step of it all!

Happy Math!
